		<h1>v1. Why Do We Care About Unemployment?</h1>
		<p>
			In this lecture, we discussed the importance of understanding unemployment
			in macroeconomics. We examined data to motivate the use of the matching
			function and discuss its theoretical properties. We explored why
			unemployment is such an important problem, noting the various ways in
			which it affects the lives of individuals and economies.

		<h2>Why Do We Care About Unemployment?</h2>
		<p>
			When thinking about microeconomic issues, three topics are often
			mentioned: growth domestic product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment. GDP
			growth is not a striking problem in developed economies, and inflation has
			become more stable. This leaves us with the problem of unemployment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Job loss is a deeply personal experience, as it often affects someone's
			identity, wellbeing, and sense of purpose. Well-being surveys have
			consistently shown that unemployment is one of the most costly life
			events, alongside divorce and the death of a family member. Unemployment
			also represents a waste of resources, as available workers are not being
			used.
		</p>
		<h2>Matching Function</h2>
		<p>
			To understand and reduce unemployment, we use the matching function. The
			matching function is a tool used to study labor markets and macroeconomics
			in advanced economies. It is designed to adapt to the different histories
			and institutions of each country.
		</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Unemployment is an important issue in macroeconomics because of its
			personal and economic impact. We use the matching function to understand
			and reduce unemployment, as it is designed to adapt to the different
			histories and institutions of each country.
