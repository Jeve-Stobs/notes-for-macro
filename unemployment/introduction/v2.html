		<h1>v2. Absence of Unemployment in the Competitive Model</h1>
		<p>
			In a typical labor market model, the labor market is represented by a
			price on the y-axis and a quantity on the x-axis. The demand for labor is
			usually a decreasing function of the wage, and the supply is usually an
			increasing function of the wage, as shown in the following diagram:

		<h2>Equilibrium</h2>
		<p>
			The equilibrium is at the intersection of the supply and the demand, which
			gives the quantity of labor $Q^*$ and the wage $W^*$. In this competitive
			setup, if the wage is above $W^*$, then there are more people who want to
			work at that wage than currently have jobs. In response, people will lower
			the wage they require and the wage will eventually reach the equilibrium.
			If the wage is below $W^*$, then firms will offer higher wages until they
			can hire enough workers. Thus, the wage will always adjust until it
			reaches the equilibrium where supply equals demand.
		</p>
		<h2>Tightness</h2>
		<p>
			The key property here is that unemployment is always zero because the
			market is always in equilibrium. This competitive paradigm does not allow
			for any unemployment, so economists must develop a new way of thinking
			about markets. To this end, one should introduce a new variable called
			<em>tightness</em>, which generalizes the two-dimensional graph to a
			three-dimensional market. Tightness is a measure of how many people are
			available to work compared to the number of jobs available. With this new
			variable, the market can now move away from the competitive paradigm and
			allow for unemployment.
